# Thermo-State-Equation-Solver
This is a tool to solve for certain variables in several thermodynamic state equations that describe gasses
This is an open source tool owned and maintained by Eugene Chung

# Installation
1. Clone the repo to a folder on your local machine
2. Install python if you have not already. (Recomended Version 3.10+)
3. Install the necessary python packages: sympy
4. Run the program in the terminal

   Windows:
   python C:\path\to\file\Solver.py

   MacOS and Linux:
   python path/to/file/Solver.py

# Usage
1. Choose the equation of state you want to work with by typing in on of the options whown in the menu (currently 1, 2, or 3)
2. Chose the variable you want to solve for (Input mest be in uppercase)
3. Enter the values for the other variables in the quations.
4. Output value will be printed at the bottom on the terminal
